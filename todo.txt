- move components to modules & use connect in components
- refactor selectors (rename *Selector to select*)
- cleanup refactoring adaptors
- cleanup TODO
- untangle libraries from utils
- refactor models
- eslint
- export const actions = createActions({ => export const { actions } = createActions({
